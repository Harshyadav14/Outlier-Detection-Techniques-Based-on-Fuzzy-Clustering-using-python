# Outlier-Detection-Techniques-Based-on-Fuzzy-Clustering-using-python
# Abstract
In this minor project, I have implemented the Outlier detection techniques based on Fuzzy clustering , namely, FCM & NC. the results showed that FCM is not the best way for producing efficient clusters from the noisy datasets. whereas performance of NC improves over FCM. When the performance of these techniques was compared, the results showed that NC is the better way for producing clusters from the noisy datasets
